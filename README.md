# Prediction-of-Pollutants-in-Vehicles
The proposal of the research project is, Prediction of pollutants by using machine learning.  It has been discussed in multiple aspects which have been defined throughout the article. The environment has direct impact of emissions, where the gases exhausted from different sectors like, industries, vehicles, aerial and water craft. Detecting the emissions by reducing and controlling its emission level can solve the major part of the issue. The pollutants, like CO2, SO2, NOx, Particulate Matter (PM) gases which exist air, these gases can be predicted by depending upon the respective parameters. The standard way of Vehicles emissions i.e., pollutants can be predicted by considering the parameters like, engine size, cylinders, emission rating, vehicle class, transmissions, fuel type, fuel consumption in city, consumption of fuel in High-way, fuel consumption in combination, Co2 emission, smog rating. Emissions can be controlled by fixing the catalytic converters in the exhaust pipe. This makes a massive difference in the environment.
